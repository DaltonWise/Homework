        "Concatenating Dataframes:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   you are stacking identical data sets on top of eachother.\n",
        "*   Each column is matched up based on column name, and any missing data is set as an NaN. These NaN values would be for columns that were added or subtracted. In the example he gave, we had data from 2016, 2017, and 2018. Each of the data sets was the same data ran in different years, and because they were ran in different years they have different columns that just get added over time.\n",
        "*   You can use Key parameters to add like an extra label to a row. This lets you know which data set that row came from.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The line of code he used to concatenate the dataframes from 2016, 2017, and 2018 was:\n",
        "\n",
        "pd.concat([data18, data17, data16], keys = [2018, 2017, 2016])\n",
        "\n",
        "So we chose the data sets in the first section of the code, and gave a key to each row from their corresponding data set. The keys are usually added as a column. The year may not always be a column in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Real-world Example:\n",
        "*   You receive one file from each of your regional operating companies\n",
        "*   You want to quickly do analysis across all of those data files.\n",
        "\n",
        "It makes sense taht if the data is similar you would concatenate it to make the process easier. You would probably make the key the name of whichever regional operating company the data came from.\n",
        "\n",
        "csvs = []\n",
        "\n",
        "for f in file_names:\n",

        "\n",
        "pd.concat(csvs, keys = file_names)\n",
        "\n",
        "So what was done here is we have a list csvs=[] that has the file for each of the regioanl operating systems we work with. So for f in file_names is asking you to go through every file in the list of file names and append them and read them in as a csv. We then uses pandas.concat to concatenate all of the data sets into one large data set. We have an extra row for the key we chose which in this case is the file name.\n",

        "Concatenating DataFrames:\n",

        "*   Missing data are left as NaN.\n",
        "\n",
        "pd.concat([data16, data17, data18], axis = 1)\n",
        "\n",
        "So with the 2016, 2017, and 2018 data, assuming we have a column that is shared with each of them, say a department ID, we would use that as the row index and connect each dataset side to side. We placed Axis = 1. This made sure we were going to put them side to side. The default is axis = 0 and will stack them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Coalescing DataFrames:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   This is filling in missing values by overlaying one data frame over another.\n",
